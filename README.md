# Compiling
## Windows

```bash
# grab lua-bgfx and all the submodules...
git clone https://github.com/excessive/lua-bgfx.git --recursive
cd lua-bgfx

# since SDL2 isn't likely to be available system-wide, so...
git clone https://github.com/spurious/SDL-mirror.git extern/sdl

# build
cmd /Cbuild.bat
```

**Note**: *The build script assumes vs2013 - 12/15 might work, but you'll need to edit the `%GENIE% vs2013` line.* 

For the exceedingly lazy, you can run the test program with `run.bat` 

## Linux
First, install `SDL2-devel` and `luajit-devel` (on Fedora, you can just `dnf install SDL2-devel luajit-devel`

```bash
# grab lua-bgfx and the submodules...
git clone https://github.com/excessive/lua-bgfx.git --recursive && cd lua-bgfx

# generate the project files...
./extern/bx/tools/bin/linux/genie gmake

# build
make -j9
```
